            <div class="mission-text">
                <p>The VFS Incinerator is an application on the vebetterDAO. Users can burn the weekly selected NFT collections for a return of $B3TR token. From 2021 to the present, hundreds of thousands of NFTs have been created and distributed across the blockchain. Many of these projects and their founders have abandoned their communities, leaving the user's assets completely illiquid and virtually worthless.</p>
                <p>These communities are made up of the very fabric that is "vefam". Not only will the Incinerator give these users a "way out" but it will create hundreds of thousands of meaningful and sustainable events along the way.</p>
                <p>Thank you for showing interest in the VFS Incinerator, and please support our application if you find our initiative to be sustainable and healthy for the vechain ecosystem.</p>
